# CSCI-201-Principle-of-Software-Engineering
A final project created by me along with 4 other students. 

This project recreates the chessboard game "Khet", which involves two players playing against each other. Our goal is to implement a playable “Khet” game that runs on the desktop and can be played over a local network.
A detailed Project Documentation can be found in this repository, it includes the high level requirements, technical specifications, and the detailed design documentation.

This Project is implemented using Java programming language. In addition, the project is mainly built on LibGDX game-development application framework. LibGDX framework helps handle the basics implementative functionalities of the game such as loading assets, processing user input, rendering, and creating graphical user interface. IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate is used for development.
